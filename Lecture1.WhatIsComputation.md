# Lecture 1: What is Computation

## Topics
- represent knowledge with data structures
- iteration and recursion as computational metaphors
- abstraction of procedures and data types
- organization and modularize systems using object classes and methods
- different classes of algorithms, searching and sorting
- complexity of algorithms

## What does a computer do
- Fundamentally:
	- performs calculations
	- remember (store) results
- What kinds of calculations
	- built-in to the language
	- programmer defined calculations
- Computers only do what you tell them to do

## Types of knowledge
- declarative knowledge is a statement of fact
- imperative knowledge is the recipe or "how to"

### An Example
- declarative: square root of a number x is y such that y*y = x
- imperative: recipe for deducing square root of a number x
	1. Start with a guess, g
	2. If g*g is close enough to x, stop and say g is the answer
	3. Otherwise make a new guess by averaging g and x/g
	4. Using the new guess, repeat process until close enough
