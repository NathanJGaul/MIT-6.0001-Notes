# Lecture 1: What is Computation

## Topics
- represent knowledge with data structures
- iteration and recursion as computational metaphors
- abstraction of procedures and data types
- organization and modularize systems using object classes and methods
- different classes of algorithms, searching and sorting
- complexity of algorithms

## What does a computer do
- Fundamentally:
	- performs calculations
	- remember (store) results
- What kinds of calculations
	- built-in to the language
	- programmer defined calculations
- Computers only do what you tell them to do
